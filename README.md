## 🎯 Objectives

* Design and implement a **cloud-based ETL pipeline** for Olympic data.
* Automate **data ingestion, transformation, and analytics**.
* Showcase integration of multiple **Azure services** with version control on GitHub.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion** – CSV files ingested from GitHub using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**.
2. **Data Lake Storage** – Raw and processed data stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (separate containers for `raw-data` and `transformed-data`).
3. **Data Processing** – Used **Azure Databricks (Spark)** for:

   * Data cleaning
   * Deduplication
   * Feature engineering
   * Transformations
4. **Data Warehouse** – Loaded transformed datasets into **Azure Synapse Analytics (Lake Database)** for robust SQL querying and insights.
5. **Automation & Monitoring** – Implemented **ADF scheduling and monitoring** to ensure reliable and timely pipeline refresh.
6. **Version Control** – All Databricks notebooks and ADF workflows cloned into **GitHub** for collaboration and reproducibility.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** – Data ingestion, orchestration, scheduling
* **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)** – Raw and curated data storage
* **Azure Databricks (Apache Spark)** – Data cleaning, transformations, feature engineering
* **Azure Synapse Analytics** – SQL querying, analytics-ready storage
* **GitHub** – Version control and project showcase

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Examples)

* Medal distribution across countries and sports
* Athlete performance analysis
* Historical trends of Olympic participation
* Country-wise comparisons

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darshant15/Tokyo-OlympicData-Azure-Dataengineering-Project.git
   ```
2. Import the notebooks into **Azure Databricks**.
3. Configure **ADF pipelines** with proper linked services for GitHub and ADLS.
4. Run pipeline to ingest → transform → load data.
5. Query insights using **Synapse Analytics**.
